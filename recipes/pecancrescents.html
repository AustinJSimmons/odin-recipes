    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>A spin on classic shortbread, a crumbly holiday cookie with a toasted nut taste. You won't just one!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups of all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp fine salt</li>
        <li>2 cups unsalted butter, at room temp</li>
        <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup pecans, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp bourbon or brandy</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat oven to 325 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour and salt together in a large bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Throw pecans into a food processer or blender until finely ground, careful not to over blend into a paste.</li>
        <li>Combine butter and granulated sugar in a separate large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high until light and fluffy, about 3-4 mins.</li>
        <li>Beat in 2 tsp of water, the vanilla and the bourbon. Slowly mix in flour mixture and finally, the pecans.</li>
        <li>Take tablespoon size pieces of dough,roll each to form a crescent shape and arrange evenly spaced on prepared baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake until slightly golden on edges and bottom, 10-12 mins. Watch very carefully, better to undercook than overcook. Let cookies cool on baking sheets for a few minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 10 mins. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Put powdered sugar into a seive. Once cookies are cooled, dust with sugar. Enjoy! :)</li>
    </ol>
